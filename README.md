# The instances of A novel initial solution construction method and efficient heuristic algorithm for trucks collaboration with drones for parcel delivery
Including the matlab code of generating the instances as well as the small-size instances and the larger-size instances adopted in the paper named A study of trucks collaborating with drones for parcel delivery with time windows
The small-size instances include customers with the number ranging from 70-100. Each instance has two types according to its width of time window, but share the same customer locations.
The larger-size instances include customers with the number ranging from 150-200. Each instance has only one type with 30min width of time window.
Each instance consists of (x	y	demand	open	close	servicetime)
x: Customer's horizontal coordinate
y: Customer's vertical coordinate
demand: Customer's demand for parcel delivery
open: Customer's opening time of its time window
close: Customer's closing time of its time window
servicetime: The time required to serve the customer
